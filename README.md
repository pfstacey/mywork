# mywork
A window into my computer science work
The txt files are supporting data to the python and java files
I wrote all of these files either alone or with a partner for group projects at school
The only exception is thacherphot.py which is an accumulation of functions written by my high school astronomy teacher and around 10 of his students including myself
